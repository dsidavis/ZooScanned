abstract = "Abstract. Following the diagnosis in 1981 of the first case of Crimean-Congo hemor- rhagic fever (CCHF) in South Africa, an antibody survey was undertaken on cattle sera to determine the distribution of the virus and specific diagnostic tests were routinely applied to specimens from suspected cases of hemorrhagic fever to establish the medical significance of its presence. Antibody to CCHF virus was demonstrated by reversed passive hemag- glutination-inhibition technique in 2,460/8,667 (28%) cattle sera and in 140/180 herds tested in South Africa, as well as in 347/763 (45%) cattle sera and in 32/34 (94%) herds tested in Zimbabwe. The antibody was found in all major cattle farming areas, but was of low prevalence along the southern coast where 2 of the 3 species of Hyalomma tick which occur in South Africa are absent. From February 1981 to January 1986, inclusive, 29 indigenous cases of CCHF were diagnosed in 16 outbreaks which arose in various locations throughout South Africa. A further 2 imported cases of CCHF arose in Zaire and Tanzania. The clinical features of infection conformed to the classical descriptions of CCHF in the Soviet Union. The fatal outcome in 11/31 cases indicates that the African disease is no less severe than that which occurs in Eurasia. It is inferred that the virus is widespread in all countries in Africa and Eurasia which lie within the limits of world distribution of ticks of the genus Hyalomma. ", 
introduction = "The first case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) to be recognized in South Africa occurred in a child who was bitten by a tick in the western portion of the Transvaal province in 1981.'-2 There was speculation that the incident may have resulted from recent introduction of the virus into the country through the transport of infected tick vectors on migratory birds.’ However, it was soon established that there was a high prevalence of virus in ticks in the area where the infection took place and that antibody to the virus was common in the sera of sheep and cattle on surrounding farms.? Futhermore, antibody was present in the sera of hares col- lected in each of the 4 provinces of the country up to 4 years prior to the recognition of the dis- ease.2 The implication was that the virus was widespread in South Africa and had probably been present for many years, but it remained necessary to determine the full extent of its dis- tribution and to establish the medical signifi- cance of its presence. We subsequently presented   Accepted 19 August 1986. preliminary results of a countrywide antibody survey on cattle sera and reported diagnosing a further 15 cases of the disease up until the end of September 1984.35 Since then a further 13 indigenous plus 2 imported cases of the disease have been diagnosed. This paper summarizes all 31 cases seen in the country up until the end of January 1986 and presents the final results of an antibody survey on 9,430 cattle sera from 214 herds in South Africa and Zimbabwe.",

`MATERIALS AND METHODS` = "MATERIALS AND METHODS Specimens  The antibody survey performed on cattle sera includes 170 specimens collected on 5 farms dur- ing the ornginal investigation of CCHF in the western Transvaal in 1981.2 A further 8,497 cat- tle sera from 175 farms were selected for the survey from specimens collected by the Division of Veterinary Services in 1983 and 1984 in the course of a campaign to accredit brucellosis-free herds in South Africa. One herd per administra- tive district was chosen at random and whenever  120  CRIMEAN-CONGO HEMORRHAGIC FEVER IN SOUTHERN AFRICA possible 50 sera per herd were tested for CCHF antibody. Cattle sera from Zimbabwe comprised 763 specimens from 34 herds collected from 1973 to 1978, inclusive, in the course of investigations of infertility and Rift Valley fever.” From 10 to 32 sera were tested per herd.  Specimens submitted by physicians from pa- tients suspected to be suffering from CCHF con- sisted of whole blood without anticoagulant. From deceased patients specimens consisted of blood collected by cardiac puncture plus liver samples taken by means of biopsy needles or limited autopsy and submitted in duplicate in physiological saline and formalin fixative. Par- affin sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin were examined for histopathological lesions. Ticks which had bitten or merely been found on people were submitted to the laboratory by med- ical practitioners or members of the public.  Virus isolations  Isolation of virus from patients was as de- scribed previously. * Sera and liver suspensions were inoculated onto monolayers of CER? and/ or E6 Vero® cells in Lab-Tek 8-well culture chamber slides (Miles Laboratories Inc., Weston, Illinois) and intracerebrally into day-old mice. Isolation was confirmed by performing indirect immunofluorescence (IF) tests on replicate cell cultures with CCHF immune mouse ascitic fluid!© at intervals up to 14 days post-inoculation, or by performing complement fixation (CF) tests on the brains of mice which died during 2 weeks of observation. Individual ticks were identified and homogenized in 1 ml of cell culture medium and centrifuged; the supernatant was inoculated into mice for isolation of virus as described previ- ously.? The intensity of viremia in patients was assayed in a few instances in terms of fluorescent focus forming units (FFU) of virus in cell cul- tures. '!  Serological tests  IF tests were performed as described by John- son et al.,'? CF tests as described by Blackburn and Swanepoel,!? reversed passive hemaggluti- nation-inhibition (RPHI) tests as described by Swanepoel et al.,'® and immunodiffusion (ID) tests as described by Clarke.!* Human sera were tested for antibody to CCHF virus by IF tech-  121 nique and cattle sera by RPHI technique. IF and ID tests were applied to a number of cattle sera for comparative and confirmatory purposes. In IF tests for IgG antibody, dilutions of patients’ sera were allowed to react with CCHF antigen cells for 30 min at 37°C before the slides were washed and reacted with anti-human IgG fluo- rescein conjugate. In IgM tests patients’ sera were allowed to react with the antigen for 1.5 hr and anti-IgM conjugate was used. Fluorescein-la- beled anti-human and anti-bovine immunoglob- ulins were from Cooper Biomedical Inc. (Mal- vern, Pennsylvania).  Case histories and the results of clinical lab- oratory tests on patients were obtained from the attendant physicians or from publications!: !5-!? and additional blood chemistry tests were per- formed in our laboratory with kits and a VP II analyzer from Abbott Diagnostics (Irving, Tex- as).", 

RESULTS = "RESULTS Cattle sera survey  The sera included in the survey are represen- tative of all major cattle farming areas in South Africa and Zimbabwe. No herd samples were obtained from the central and northwestern Cape province of South Africa, nor from the Zambezi Valley in the north of Zimbabwe and the portion of the Limpopo Valley in the extreme southeast of Zimbabwe, which are not cattle farming areas. RPHI antibody to CCHF virus was found in 2,460/8,667 (28%) of cattle sera and in 140/180 herds tested in South Africa. The proportion of reactors was 2,460/6,762 (36%) if 1,905 sera from 40 seronegative herds are omitted from consid- eration. In Zimbabwe, RPHI antibody was found in 347/763 (45%) of cattle sera and in 32/34 herds. The proportion of reactors in seropositive herds was 347/727 (48%). Antibody was absent from most herds along the southern coast from Cape Town to East London, or were present in <4% of cattle on average in seropositive herds in this area where Hyalomma truncatum is pres- ent but the other 2 South African Hyalomma ticks, H. marginatum rufipes and H. m. turani- cum, are absent'® 2° (Fig. 1).  Antibody was prevalent in the interior with a tendency for the proportion of positive herds and positive cattle within herds to increase north- wards to Zimbabwe where high stocking rates led to the occurrence of abundant tick popula- tions. '8 The prevalence of antibody exceeded 90% in some herds in the interior. In the few instances where it was possible to establish the ages of individual cattle from which sera were obtained, there was a clear tendency for the prevalence of antibody to increase with age. It is clear (Table 1) that there is a gradation of decreasing sensi- tivity between RPHI, IF, and ID tests, but that there is good agreement between the tests in dem- onstrating antibody in sera with high RPHI ti- ters.  CCHF patients  The locations and months of occurrence of 31 cases of CCHF are shown in Table 2 in relation to the source of infection, the outcome of infec- tion, and the manner in which the diagnosis was confirmed in each instance. The cases occurred in 18 separate outbreaks and the locations where infection took place are shown in Figure 1 in relation to the distribution of antibody in cattle sera. The completeness and reliability of infor- mation available on individual patients vary considerably. Nosocomial cases were studied in greatest detail, while some patients did not seek medical attention during their illness but were questioned later and others were brought to hos-pital in moribund state with fragmentary histo- ries. Sufficient reliable data are available to con- struct an informative composite picture of the disease seen in South Africa. The means of exposure to infection, mean in- cubation periods, and manner in which the di- agnosis was confirmed in each case are sum- marized in Table 3. In 3 of the tick transmissions, adult Hyalomma ticks were involved. Patient 31 (Table 2) was bitten by unidentified immature ticks while walking between Kigoma and Ujiji in Tanzania. He was not exposed to blood, meat, or other tissues of animals during his travels in December 1985 and January 1986. Two days after being bitten by the ticks in Tanzania he became ill in Zambia and was hospitalized there briefly before convalescing in South Africa. In 9 instances where patients were exposed to fresh blood and other tissues of livestock, sheep and cattle were involved,> 4 while the tenth patient slaughtered ostriches and handled adult Hy- alomma ticks in the process. One patient in whom the means of exposure to infection was uncertain, was an executive who lived in Lumumbashi, Zaire, and traveled in the countryside to inspect industrial gas installations. Four days before on- set of his illness he visited a cattle farm. At least 6 of the 8 nosocomial infections occurred in peo- ple who were known to have had exposure to patients’ blood, either through needle pricks or through spillage of blood onto hands with broken skin.  Clinical signs and symptoms. In 22 instances the onset of illness was extremely sudden, with severe headache usually being the earliest symp- tom (Fig. 2). This frequently was accompanied by dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, sore eyes, and photophobia. Fever with rigors and chills became evident at the same time or shortly there- after. Patients rapidly developed general myalgia and malaise, with intense backache or leg pains. Nausea, sore throat, and vomiting were common at the onset of illness and about half of the pa- tients experienced nonlocalized abdominal pain, sometimes intense, and diarrhea. Fever was in- termittent and in the course of the next day or 2 patients experienced sharp changes of mood, with feelings of confusion and aggression; some even had bouts of violent behavior. Patients seen by clinicians on days 2 to 4 of illness often ex- hibited lassitude, depression, and somnolence. They were flushed and had injected conjunctivae or chemosis. Right upper quadrant tenderness of the abdomen and hepatomegaly were discernible in about half. Tachycardia was common and there was a tendency for patients to be slightly hypo- tensive. Lymphadenopathy was recorded in 3 patients, with moderate swelling of inguinal, ax- illary, and/or cervical glands. There was enan- them and petechiae of the throat, tonsils, and buccal mucosa in some.  A petechial rash of the trunk and limbs com- monly appeared on days 3 to 6 of illness and in some there were large ecchymoses and bruises, especially in the antecubital fossae, upper arms, and axillae. Most patients exhibited a hemor- rhagic tendency and in a few instances this was evident at the onset of illness through the oc- currence of episodes of epistaxis and hematem- esis from the first day onwards. Hematemesis and melena were common by day 4 to 5 and were usually marked by dark, ‘coffee grounds”  CRIMEAN-CONGO HEMORRHAGIC FEVER IN SOUTHERN AFRICA vomitus and tarry stools, although in some in- stances fresh blood was voided. Proteinuria was detected at an early stage in a few instances and later hematuria was common. Bleeding from the vagina was common and gingival bleeding oc- curred. There was oozing of blood from injection sites and cerebral hemorrhage was diagnosed in 3 patients, while 1 had retroperitoneal hemor- rhage with abdominal distension. The more se- verely ill patients were reported to enter a state of hepatorenal failure from about day 5 onwards and progressively became drowsy, stuporous, and comatose. Jaundice was noted in the second week in several patients.  Deaths. Altogether 11/31 patients died. One patient who died on the third day of illness ap- parently suffered cerebral hemorrhage and another who died on day 27 acquired bacterial meningitis as a complication to surgery for ce- rebral hemorrhage. Otherwise, deaths all oc- curred from day 6 to 14 of illness. Factors con- tributing to fatal outcome included cerebral hemorrhage in a third patient, severe anemia de- spite vigorous blood replacement therapy, severe dehydration and shock associated with protract- ed diarrhea, lung edema, and pleural effusion. Ultimately, patients who died were reported to have developed multiple organ failure including cerebral, liver, and kidney failure and cardiac and pulmonary insufficiency. Observations on monitoring of blood gasses and electrolytes in 3 terminally ill patients have been reported else- where. ! 15.16  Convalescence. The rash faded in patients who recovered and they began to improve from about the ninth or tenth day of illness, although as- thenia commonly lasted for a month or longer. Some patients were said to be suffering from con- junctivitis or suffused eyes, slight confusion, and amnesia when discharged from hospital during the third week after onset.  Viremia. Virus was isolated from the only available serum sample taken on the first day of illness and viremia was demonstrated with fa- cility from later blood specimens taken up until the eighth day of illness. Thereafter, viremia was demonstrated in a few instances only, at low titer, up until the twelfth day of illness. Titrations of viremia were performed on a limited number of occasions in cell cultures and the maximum titer recorded was 3.7 log,, FFU of virus per ml. In 6 patients viremia remained demonstrable for a  125 number of days despite intravenous administra- tion of immune plasma with proven neutralizing ability. Virus was isolated for 7 consecutive days from the blood of one patient who received sev- eral units of immune plasma.  Hematology and coagulation studies. Two pa- tients had elevated leukocyte counts when first tested and 4 had counts within the normal range, while white cell counts were low in 13 other pa- tients. The leukocyte counts fell progressively in all patients and, in most, reached leukopenic levels of <3 x 10? cells/l at some stage during the period from day 3 to 12 of illness, with ab- solute lymphopenia tending to precede neutro- penia. The counts recovered towards the end of the second week. Thrombocytopenia was a con- sistent feature of the infection and counts fell below 100 x 10° platelets/l in most patients at some stage during the period from day 3 to 15 of illness. In 8 patients the counts fell below 20 x 10° platelets/1 without necessarily being as- sociated with overt bleeding or fatal outcome. The histological appearance of a bone marrow biopsy specimen was described as normal in one nonfatal case and in another there was said to be “toxic depression’ of myelopoiesis and plate- let genesis.  In limited observations, mildly depressed plasma fibrinogen and elevated serum fibrin deg- radation product levels were recorded from days 2 to 12 of illness and moderately abnormal pro- thrombin indices and partial thromboplastin times were recorded during the second week of illness. Observations on platelets and coagula- tion were probably affected by therapeutic administration of fresh frozen plasma, cryopre- cipitate, heparin, and platelets in several pa- tients. In at least 2 fatal cases there was evidence of a degree of complement consumption and im- mune complex formation.!> Low hemoglobin values were recorded in some patients from day 3 onwards and levels fell as low as 4 g/dl in 2 fatal infections despite vigorous blood replace- ment therapy. Most patients showed a decline in hemoglobin level during the second week of ill- ness, even in instances where overt hemorrhage had not been a marked feature of the disease.  Clinical chemistry studies. All of the patients tested had elevated serum aspartate aminotrans- ferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (yGT) values. Raised AST values were already evident in some patients on the first day of illness while elevated ALT and yGT values were detected from the fifth day of illness onwards (Fig. 2). AST and ALT values >1,000 U/l were associated with fatal outcome. Hyperbilirubinemia, and in some instances jaundice, became evident from the ninth day onwards and there was an increase in both total and direct bilirubin readings. Serum cre- atine kinase (CK) levels were not abnormal in the first week of illness but were markedly ele- vated in the second week. Total serum protein and albumin levels were moderately depressed during the first week of illness, but were elevated from the end of the second week onwards. Plas- ma and blood therapy probably affected obser- vations in a few patients. Irregular increases in blood urea levels were observed from day 3 on- wards, and there was a clear tendency for the levels to be elevated from the end of the second week in all patients who were tested (Fig. 2). This was at a stage when patients were usually dis- charged from hospital so that the timing of the reversal of this trend was not observed. In a very few instances where tests were performed, ele- vated serum creatinine levels were observed from day 4 onwards.  Histopathological examination of liver speci- mens. Necrotic lesions were present in 4 of 6 liver specimens taken from deceased patients. The lesions varied from disseminated foci in- volving <25% of hepatocytes in one patient to massive necrosis involving > 75% of hepatocytes in another. In one patient in whom necrotic le- sions were not found, the specimen was very small. The other patient in whom liver lesions were not found died on the 27th day of illness from a complication to brain surgery; regenera- tion of liver tissue may have already taken place.  Antibody response. Eight of the 11 patients who died failed to mount an immune response which could be detected by IF test, but it should be noted that 3 of these patients succumbed before the seventh day of illness when antibody first became demonstrable in survivors. Among the 3 fatal cases in which antibody was detected, patient 28 received multiple transfusions of im- mune plasma and developed moderate levels of IgG antibody, but exhibited weak and transient IgM antibody activity so that it appears unlikely that endogenous antibody response occurred. In contrast, there was an antibody reponse in pa- tient 5 who died on day 27 of illness of a com-  127 plication to brain surgery. The same appears to be true for patient 24 who died on day 9 of illness and in whom IgM and IgG antibodies were dem- onstrated in a single blood sample taken post- mortem.  In all of the survivors of CCHF infection, spe- cific IgM and IgG antibodies became demon- strable in IF tests by days 7 to 9 of illness, except that detection of an IgG response was compli- cated in 7 of the survivors by administration of immune plasma. The immune plasma units lacked or had very low IgM titers so that the onset of IgM antibody response could neverthe- less be detected readily in all of the treated sur- vivors except one. The exception was patient 16 in whom the diagnosis of CCHF is consequently regarded as uncertain (Tables 2 and 3). Maxi- mum IgM IF titers detected in individuals ranged from 1:64 to 1:512 and were attained by day 9 to 23 of illness. The IgM IF antibody titers had declined and/or disappeared by 4 months after onset of illness. The highest IgG IF antibody titers recorded in individuals during the first 3 weeks after onset of illness ranged from 1:64 to 1:2,048. There was a tendency for the IgG IF antibody titers to undergo a sharp increase, up to levels of 1:4,096, between 2 and 4 months after onset of illness. Patients who had received immune plasma therapy generally developed lower maximum titers than untreated patients.  Treatment. Details of supportive treatment, antiviral therapy and/or prophylaxis have been presented elsewhere for 9 of the patients!: 5-17.21 and the relevant information on some of the more recent cases will be published in due course.  Identification and viral assay of ticks  Twelve out of 18 ticks which had bitten or been found on people during 1984 and 1985 were H. truncatum males, 3 were H. marginatum ru- fipes adults, one was a semi-engorged H. m. ru- fipes larva removed from the ear of a 2-year-old child, 1 was an H. m. turanicum adult, and 1 was an Argas persicus adult. None of the ticks was found to be infected and none of the ticks we received had bitten people who developed CCHF.",

DISCUSSION = "DISCUSSION  CCHF has been described as an emerging dis- ease.?? The first outbreak of “Crimean hemor-  128 rhagic fever’ occurred in the Soviet Union in 1944 and the causative agent was isolated in 1967.23 “Congo” virus was first isolated in Zaire in 1956.24 The 2 viruses were shown to be iden- tical in 19682% 26 and by the time that Hoogstraal reviewed the literature in 1979,27 virus or anti- body had been found in the Soviet Union, Bul- garia, Greece, Turkey, Hungary, Yugoslavia, France, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Zaire, Sen- egal, Nigeria, the Central African Republic, Ke- nya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Egypt. Subsequent to 1979, the presence of virus or an- tibody has been confirmed in China, Iraq, Dubai, Upper Volta, Mauritania, Iran, Greece, Portugal, Zimbabwe, and Nigeria, ?®-32 while 29 indigenous plus 2 imported cases of CCHF (Zaire and Tan- zania) have been diagnosed in South Africa. Thus, the list of countries where the virus or antibody is known to occur has grown over the past 4 decades. We believe that the essential change has been an increase in recognition of the presence of the virus rather than spread of infection to new areas. The strongest evidence to support this conclusion relates to the distribution of the virus and its vectors.  CCHF virus has been isolated from many species of ticks and members of 3 genera have been shown to be capable of transmitting infec- tion, but ticks of the genus Hyalomma always have been regarded as the main vectors. Hoog- straal noted that, with the exception of atypical foci associated with human-made environmen- tal changes in Moldavia, the areas where CCHF virus was enzootic were characterized by the presence of = 1 species of Hyalomma ticks.?” The corollary to this proposition is true: the pattern of distribution of CCHF virus in Eurasia and Africa falls exactly within the limits of world distribution of ticks of the genus Hyalomma.3° The mechanisms for the dissemination of ticks, and hence virus, must have operated in this re- gion for millenia. These include the movement of livestock, wild mammals, and the many mil- lions of birds which migrate annually on a north- south axis. It is not surprising that we found antibody to CCHF virus to be widely prevalent in the sera of cattle (Fig. 1) and wild vertebrates over vast areas of South Africa and Zimbabwe where Hyalomma ticks are known to oc- cur.!%- 20-4! The detection of antibody in a high proportion of cattle sera raised doubts about the reliability of the RPHI test since only 1 case of   CCHF had been recognized in South Africa at the outset of our study. However, it was found that the RPHI results could be confirmed in IF and ID tests (Table 1) and ultimately the diag- nosis of human disease in various locations throughout the country (Fig. 1) left no doubt about the validity of the survey.  The wide distribution of antibody in the sera of cattle and wild vertebrates,*® and the fact that some of the specimens had been in storage for many years, indicates that CCHF virus has been present in southern Africa for a long time, but this in turn raises the question as to why human disease has only been recognized recently. The second and third cases of the disease to be re- corded in South Africa (patients 2 and 3 in Table 2) were not recognized as CCHF patients on clin- ical grounds, but were diagnosed as a result of retrospective investigations.? Thereafter, in- creased awareness associated with the inordinate publicity given to CCHF, and the availability of a specific diagnostic service,*2 have combined to produce increasing recognition.  In several countries in Eurasia, the presence of CCHF virus first came to be recognized in epidemics and nosocomial outbreaks which were largely human-made phenomena.?’-2% 3° The original outbreak of the disease in the Crimean peninsula involved exposure of large numbers of people to infection under circumstances created by war, and subsequent epidemics in the Soviet Union and Bulgaria followed major land recla- mation schemes or abrupt changes in agricultural or animal husbandry practice.?? ?’ In most coun- tries in Eurasia and Africa where the virus is known to occur, however, its presence was dis- covered because prospective laboratory investi- gations were undertaken rather than because a specific clinical entity had been recognized. It seems likely that further investigation will reveal the presence of the virus in the remaining coun- tries in Africa, the Mediterranean littoral, the Near East, and Asia, which lie within the geo- graphic range of Hyalomma ticks.  The fact that we received 17 Hyalomma ticks from human hosts undoubtedly stemmed from the publicity given to these ticks and CCHF, but suggests that there is a need to modify the view that the 3 species of Hyalomma which occur in this country rarely attack humans.2?-3% 43-45 The preponderance of male Hyalomma ticks found on humans possibly relates to the fact that they  CRIMEAN-CONGO HEMORRHAGIC FEVER IN SOUTHERN AFRICA spend a longer time on hosts than do females and may transfer readily between hosts,3° while the predominance of H. truncatum over H. m. rufipes ticks may reflect genuine host preferences of these species.  The first isolation of CCHF virus in Africa was made from a patient with transient febrile illness in Stanleyville (now Kisangani) in the Belgian Congo (now Zaire) and shortly thereafter the vi- rus was obtained from the investigator of the case who developed laboratory infection.?* The in- fection was confirmed in 12 patients in Uganda and in | in the Central African Republic?! 46.47 (Munube et al.*® were misquoted?’ to the effect that there was a thirteenth infection in Uganda in 1972; the reference was actually to isolation of the virus from one of the earlier patients in 1967). Of these 15 human infections which had been recorded in Africa up to 1979, 8 had oc- curred in laboratory personnel and only 1 pa- tient, in Uganda, was reported to have developed the hemorrhagic syndrome and died. Neverthe- less, Hoogstraal?’ rejected suggestions that Af- rican strains of the virus were less pathogenic for humans than Eurasian strains on the grounds that investigations had been too limited. Our series of cases now confirms that the African dis- ease is no less severe than that in Eurasia and the clinical features conform to the classical de- scriptions of CCHF in the Soviet Union.*%-5! Moreover, the 2 other CCHF infections reported in Africa recently,3! 32 were also described as cases of hemorrhagic fever.  Clinicians in the enzootic countries of Eurasia and Africa should learn to recognize CCHF at an early stage of the illness. They should be alert- ed by the occurrence of a disease with sudden onset and a short incubation period, usually less than a week, following exposure of patients to tick bite or fresh blood and other tissues of live- stock. Sometimes there may be no clear indi- cation of exposure to infection, merely a history of residing in or visiting a rural environment. The patient initially suffers from fever, nausea, prostrating headache, and myalgia. By the time that a clinician is consulted, there is usually leu- kopenia, thrombocytopenia, and raised liver en- zymes, particularly AST in the early stages, but it is essential that laboratory tests are per- formed.*? The disease is easier to recognize once the rash appears and there are hemorrhagic signs such as epistaxis, hematemesis, and melena. The  129 early stages of the disease should be distinguished from tick-borne typhus which often has a char- acteristic lesion at the site of the tick bite and a more insidious onset. Rift Valley fever can also be acquired from contact with the tissues of live- stock in Africa, but this usually occurs in the context of a massive epizootic involving abor- tion and death of sheep and cattle.3-?  In the past, patients with CCHF and other viral hemorrhagic fevers were usually treated under circumstances where lack of facilities and the daunting nature of the infectious agents preclud- ed the performance of detailed clinical pathology studies, with the result that the underlying dis- ease-producing mechanisms remained poorly understood.3? Recently there has been a trend towards studying the pathogenesis and pathology of viral hemorrhagic fevers in animal models and to making detailed observations on hospitalized patients,’>3-%3 as occurred in some of the cases which we report. Although we concur that the lesions seen in viral hemorrhagic fever often fail to account for the severity of disease, we submit that factors such as cerebral hemorrhage, lung edema, massive liver necrosis, as well as extreme anemia and dehydration in untreated cases, readily account for fatal outcome. Evidence sug- gesting that the essential lesion in viral hemor- rhagic fever (as in nonviral hemorrhagic fevers) is endothelial damage, goes a long way towards explaining many of the features of the condi- tion, !3-62. 63 and accords well with the alternative name ‘capillary toxicosis” given to CCHF by the early workers in the Soviet Union.?* En- dothelial damage would account for the occur- rence of a rash and would contribute directly to the failure of vital organs such as the lungs and kidneys. It would also contribute to hemostatic failure through platelet degranulation and acti- vation of the intrinsic coagulation cascade, but disseminated intravascular coagulation appears to be an irregular and terminal event in viral hemorrhagic fever.",
