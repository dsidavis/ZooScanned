Abstract = "Abstract. An ecological study was conducted during 1983 and 1984 to evaluate the role of selected hematophagous ar- thropods as possible vectors and/or reservoirs of Jamestown Canyon (JC) virus on the Delaware-Maryland-Virginia Penin- sula, USA. Arthropods were collected and assayed for virus in Vero cells by standard plaque technique. Sera from sentinel goats, free-ranging goats, and wild vertebrates were assayed for JC-virus-neutralizing (N) antibody by plaque-reduction neu- tralization tests. This virus was not isolated from 158,253 adult bloodsucking insects, including 139,392 Aedes mosquitoes and 3,572 other biting flies, nor from 44,785 Aedes mosquitoes reared from larvae and 3,328 ticks collected as nymphs or adults. How- ever, 2 isolates of Cache Valley virus were obtained from Aedes mosquitoes. Serological evidence indicated that JC virus was transmitted to domestic goats during May 1983 and June 1984. Also, antibody was demonstrated in sera obtained from the Eastern Cottontail (4/13), Virginia Opossum (4/25), Raccoon (11/141), and White-tailed Deer (34/47). The absence of JC virus in Aedes mosquitoes in the presence of virus transmission to mammals strongly implies that this virus was maintained and transmitted in this area by arthropods other than Aedes mos- quitoes.",

introduction = "Jamestown Canyon (JC) virus, a member of the genus Bunyavirus (Bunyaviridae), was recently doc- umented as the cause of human encephalitis in Michigan (Grimstad et al. 1982), New York (Sri- hongse et al. 1984), and Ontario, Canada (Deibel et al. 1983). Since the original isolation of JC virus in 1961 from Culiseta inornata (Williston) collected in Colorado (Berge 1975), ca. 160 viral isolations have been reported, primarily from Aedes mosqui- toes (LeDuc 1979).  Aedes species reported from the Delaware-Mary- land-Virginia (Delmarva) Peninsula (Buescher et al. 1970; Saugstad et al. 1972; LeDuc et al. 1975), and from which JC virus has been isolated else where, include Aedes canadensis (Theobald) (LeDuc et al. 1975; Grayson et al. 1983; T.P. Gargan, USAMRIID, pers. comm.) and other less abundant species such as Aedes aurifer (Coq.), Aedes cinereus Meigen, Aedes triseriatus (Say) (Grayson et al. 1983), Aedes trivittatus (Coq.) (Sudia et al. 1971; Grayson et al. 1983), and Aedes vexans (Meigen) (Sudia et al. 1971; Sprance et al. 1978; Grayson et al. 1983). The virus has also been isolated elsewhere from Aedes cantator (Coq.) (Sprance et al. 1978; Main et al. 1979; Grayson et al. 1983) and Aedes sollicitans (Walker) (Sudia et al. 1971; Grayson et al. 1983). JC virus has been isolated infrequently from Co- quillettidia perturbans (Walker) (Sprance et al. 1978; Grayson et al. 1983), Anopheles crucians Wied. (Par- kin et al. 1972), Anopheles punctipennis (Say), and Anopheles quadrimaculatus Say (Berry et al. 1983). A deer fly, Chrysops cincticornis Walker, and horse flies, Hybomitra lasiophthalma (Macq.) (DeFoliart et al. 1969) and Hybomitra nuda (McD.) (Sudia et al. 1971), also yielded isolates of this virus in Wiscon- sin. Although JC virus has been isolated from many mosquito species, no definitive vector has been identified. Furthermore, the species listed as the principal vector, Culiseta inornata (Williston), cited in a review by Turell & LeDuc (1983), was rarely collected on the Delmarva Peninsula.  As with other members of the California (CAL) serogroup, most notably La Crosse (LAC) virus (Watts et al. 1973), JC virus has been isolated from Ae. triseriatus adults reared from field-collected eggs (Berry et al. 1977). It has also been recovered from Aedes mosquitoes reared from field-collected larvae in New York (D. Fish, Fordham Univ., pers. comm.) and from a pool of male Ae. stimulans group mos- quitoes in Indiana (P.R. Grimstad, Univ. Notre Dame, pers. comm.). These reports suggested that JC virus may be maintained transovarially in mos- quitoes.  Serologic studies revealed a high prevalence of JC antibody in big game animals, particularly in White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (Issel et al. 1972a,b; Hoff et al. 1973; Watts et al. 1982). by UC Davis user on 20 October 2017  1986  Also, JC virus has been isolated from this species (Issel 1973), and experimental infections produced a viremia of sufficient magnitude to potentially in- fect mosquitoes (Issel etal. 1972a; Watts etal. 1979). Serological data also implicated 3 other mammals as potential hosts of this virus on the Delmarva Peninsula from 1973 to 1980 (Watts et al. 1982). The recent association of JC virus with human cases of encephalitis emphasizes the need to iden- tify the arthropod vectors in order to devise con- trol strategies to prevent human infection. While several studies have been conducted on the Del- marva Peninsula, most have been conducted in the Pokomoke Cypress Swamp (PCS). The aim of this study was to extend investigations on the ecology of JC virus over a wider geographic area. Specific objectives were to identify the role of hematopha- gous arthropods and to delineate seasonal trans- mission patterns to wild and domestic mammals. ",

`MATERIALS AND METHODS` = "MATERIALS AND METHODS Study area  Arthropods were collected and sentinel goats were maintained at sites in Accomack County, Vir- ginia, and Worcester and Somerset counties, Mary- land, USA, in 1983 and 1984. In 1983, hematoph- agous arthropods were collected at 5 sites on the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge (CNWR) at the southern end of Assateague Island, Virginia (Fig. 1), an area described in detail by Buescher et al. (1970), and in the PCS, an area described by Saugstad et al. (1972) and LeDuc et al. (1975). In 1984, arthropod collections from goat-baited traps were shifted from CNWR to sites on the western border of the Delmarva Peninsula in Accomack and Somerset counties, near brackish-water marsh- es of Chesapeake Bay.  Field methods  Collection of arthropods. Immature mosquitoes were collected with standard larval dippers and transported to the laboratory, where they were reared to adults in water at temperatures from 18 to 22 °C. Water temperature in the field was mea- sured with a Datapod One Channel Temperature Recorder (OMNIDATA Intl. Inc., Logan, UT). Freshly emerged adults were killed by chilling at —20 °C and stored at —70 °C for subsequent iden- tification and viral assay.  Adult mosquitoes and biting flies were aspirated 2 to 3 times per week from goat-baited insect traps similar to the one described by Roberts (1965).  Clark et al.: Jamestown Canyon virus on Delmarva Peninsula  589  Goats were in place and traps were operational from early April through the end of October in 1983 and 1984. At the PCS, a Magoon trap (Ma- goon 1935) with the door removed was used as a shelter for 5 goats and also served as a site for collecting resting insects. U.S. Army miniature sol- id-state mosquito light traps (Driggers et al. 1980), baited with dry ice, were periodically used to sup- plement adult collections.  In 1984, ticks were collected from stationary sticky traps baited with dry ice (Eads et al. 1982) and from white cloth sheets after they were dragged across oak-leaf or pine-needle debris in wooded areas at PCS and CNWR, respectively. In addition, ticks were collected from wild mammals trapped at CNWR and from domestic goats at Chinco- teague Island, Virginia. All arthropods were stored at —70 °C until assayed for virus.  Vertebrate serum. Pairs of JC-virus-seronegative goats were placed in the field in early April, before hematophagous insect activity began. Approxi- mately 3 ml of blood was obtained weekly from the jugular vein of each goat throughout the study period. Goats that seroconverted were replaced with seronegative animals. Wild mammals were live- trapped, anesthetized, ear-tagged, and bled via car- diac puncture. During November and December 1983 and December 1984, blood samples were ob- tained from the thoracic cavities of White-tailed Deer at checking stations operated by wildlife agency personnel in Somerset and Accomack coun- ties. All blood specimens were stored at 4 °C for the 2 to 3 h prior to centrifugation at 800 x g for 20 min. Sera were decanted and stored at —20 °C and the remaining packed cells were stored at —70 °C.  Laboratory methods. Arthropods were identified to species on a chill table (4 °C) and placed in pools of up to 25 mosquitoes, 5 tabanids, or 10 ticks according to sex, collection site, collection date, and developmental stage. Because JC virus has rarely been isolated from Anopheles mosquitoes (Parkin et al. 1972; Berry et al. 1983), these were not assayed for virus. Laboratory procedures were described previously (Clark et al. 1985).  A 1:10 dilution of the erythrocytes from goats that developed JC virus N antibody was also tested in Vero cells for virus. Samples obtained during each of the 4 wk prior to seroconversion were as- sayed.  Viral isolates were identified by plaque-reduc- tion neutralization (PRN) tests in Vero cells. Spe-cific mouse hyperimmune ascitic fluid (MHAF) was prepared in 6- to 8-wk-old ICR female mice, as described by Brandt et al. (1967), and used for viral identification. Viral isolates were tested against MHATFs for Cache Valley (CV), eastern equine en- cephalitis, Flanders, Highlands J, JC, Keystone (KEY), LAC, trivittatus (TVT), and polyvalent Bunyamwera serogroup viruses.  Wild and domestic mammal sera were tested for JC virus N antibody by PRN tests in Vero cells. JC virus stock was originally isolated from a pool of Ae. canadensis collected at the PCS in 1979 and had undergone 2 passages in tissue culture. Sera were heat treated at 56 °C for 30 min, and a 1:10 dilution was prepared in the medium described above. An equal volume of each diluted serum and a virus suspension containing ca. 50 PFU were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and inoculated (0.1 ml in triplicate) onto Vero cells. Cells were then incubated and overlaid with 2 ml of agar overlay medium consisting of equal volumes of 1.5% aga-rose and 2X Eagle’s basal medium in Earle’s salts with Hepes buffer (4 g), 10% heat-inactivated FBS, and antibiotics. A reduction of 80% or more of the virus dose by a 1:10 dilution of a mammalian serum was our criterion for JC-virus-specific antibody. Sera positive at the 1:10 dilution to JC virus were titered against JC and KEY viruses to delineate infections with these CAL group viruses. ",

RESULTS = "RESULTS Hematophagous arthropods  Immature mosquitoes. During 1983 and 1984, a total of 46,067 immature mosquitoes was reared to the adult stage and assayed in 2,059 pools (Table 1). The predominant species were Ae. cantator (15%) and Ae. canadensis (17%). In 1984, emphasis was placed on rearing and assaying Ae. cantator, and 99% of the specimens assayed belonged to this species. Males made up ca. 50% (16,582) of the Ae. cantator specimens assayed that year. Adult mosquitoes. Goat-baited traps from all col- lection localities on the Delmarva Peninsula yield- ed 145,918 mosquitoes that were assayed for virus (Table 2). The 1983 collections from CNWR were dominated by Aedes taeniorhynchus Wied. (64%) and Ae. sollicitans (30%), of which all but ca. 6,750 and 900, respectively, were assayed for virus. In 1984, although mosquito numbers were sharply reduced in the PCS Magoon trap (Table 2), Ae. canadensis was again the most abundant species (64%).  Miniature light traps were operated in late April, mid-June, and mid-September at selected locations in 1984 (Table 3). These collections, made pri- marily to increase the number of Ae. canadensis, Ae. cantator, and Ae. vexans for viral assay, yielded 8,378 mosquitoes in these 3 species in mid-June.  Other biting flies. A total of 3,572 other biting flies was collected from goat-baited traps and as- sayed for virus (Table 4). The striped horse fly, Tabanus lineola Fabr., was the most abundant species (46%) 1n our collections, occurring in all areas but in greatest numbers at CNWR in 1983.  Interaction with vertebrate hosts. Data on the Aedes mosquitoes collected in the goat-baited traps at CNWR in 1983, and in the same traps located near Chesapeake Bay in 1984, are presented in Table 5. Apparently these species readily entered the traps, and a substantial portion of those entering actually fed. Although ca. 20,000 Anopheles, most of which were blood fed, were collected in the early spring, they were not assayed for virus.  Seasonal populations of adults. Seasonal distri- bution is an important factor in assessing the po- tential role of a particular species as an arbovirus vector. The seasonal distribution of the 3 major Aedes species collected at CNWR during 1983 is presented in Fig. 2. Data were smoothed by the “4253H, twice method,” which analyzes and plots medians of adjacent values (Velleman & Hoaglin 1981). Aedes canadensis appeared in May and soon disappeared. High tides produced large popula- tions of Ae. sollicitans and Ae. taeniorhynchus, which predominated throughout much of August and September. Figure 3 depicts the seasonal occur- rence of the 4 principal Aedes species collected from the goat-baited traps in 1984 on the Chesapeake Bay side of the Delmarva Peninsula.  The 2 most numerous Aedes species collected from the open Magoon trap at PCS during 1983 and 1984 were Ae. canadensis and Ae. cantator (Ta- ble 2). The seasonal occurrence of these 2 species is illustrated in Fig. 4. Although the number of Ae. canadensis in the collection dropped markedly from 1983 to 1984, similar trends were observed. In 1983, Ae. cantator population fluctuations corre- lated with those of Ae. canadensis, with an initial peak observed in the week ending 9 May. In 1984 the populations were greatly reduced and were de- layed by almost 4 wk.  Five principal tabanid species were collected at the PCS (Table 4). Their populations over the 1983 and 1984 seasons are presented in Fig. 5. Chrysops niger Macq. and H. lasiophthalma were notable for their occurrence during the latter half of May in  J. Med. Entomol.  Vol. 23, no. 6 both years. The seasonal distribution of the prin- cipal tabanids from CNWR (1983) and sites near Chesapeake Bay are presented in Fig. 6. The only species not abundant at PCS but depicted here 1s Chrysops flavidus Wied.  Ticks. Tick collections from 13 June to 28 Au- gust 1984 yielded 3,328 specimens in 2 species (Ta- ble 6). Of the 880 ticks collected from free-ranging goats on Chincoteague Island, 858 (98%) were adult brown dog ticks [Dermacentor variabilis (Say)]; the remaining 22 were lone star ticks [Amblyomma americanum (L.)] (21 adults and 1 nymph). Similar- ly, in tick collections from 19 Raccoons (Procyon lotor) and 2 Red Foxes (Vulpes fulva) at CNWR, 630 (89%) were D. variabilis (573 adults and 57 nymphs) and 77 (11%) were A. americanum (9 adults and 68 nymphs). Overall, D. variabilis was most abundant. During the 2 years that corralled goats were pres- ent in the PCS, none was found infested with ticks. In the same areas, tick traps and drags were very productive, especially of A. americanum nymphs, but yielded no D. variabilis nymphs and few adults of either species. From all collections, we found a female : male sex ratio of ca. 1:1 for D. variabilis and 1.7:1 for A. americanum.  Virus isolations  JC virus was not isolated from the 158,253 bloodsucking insects collected as adults, from the 44,785 Aedes mosquitoes reared from field-collect- ed larvae, or from the 3,328 ticks collected as nymphs or adults. Isolates of CV virus were ob- tained from a pool of 35 Ae. taeniorhynchus collected with a miniature light trap on 11 September and from 1 blood-fed Ae. sollicitans collected in a goat- baited trap on 24 September. Both isolates were obtained in 1984 from Somerset Co.  Vertebrates  Serological evidence of JC virus infection was not detected in blood from goats at 5 sites in the CNWR and in the PCS from 4 April through 18 May 1983. On 23 May, however, 2 of 4 goats at the PCS yielded serum with JC virus antibody, and a 3rd goat was antibody-positive on 7 June. There was no detectable antibody to KEY virus in these goats. The 4th goat never developed N antibody, nor did replacement seronegative goats. The pro- jected period of virus transmission at the PCS, based on the time required for the appearance of N an- tibody in goats following experimental infection with JC virus (Watts et al. 1982), is presented in Fig. 4. Of all goats exposed at CNWR, only one, 20 September. All other goats at CNWR remained at the site closest to Chincoteague Island, devel- seronegative through 25 October, oped JC virus N antibody. On 13 September this In 1984 all sentinel goats remained seronegative goat was negative, but it was positive when bled on from 10 April through 18 June. On 25 June, 1 of 5 goats at the PCS seroconverted, and the follow- ing week (2 July) 2 additional goats were antibody- positive (Fig. 4). The remaining 2 goats and 3 sero- negative replacement goats, brought to the PCS on 10 July, failed to seroconvert during the rest of the exposure period.  Between 11 May and 6 October 1983, a total of 243 serum samples was obtained from wild verte- brates at CNWR. JC virus antibody was found in Eastern Cottontails (Sylvilagus floridanus) (31%, 4/13), Virginia Opossums (Didelphis virginiana) (16%, 4/25), and Raccoons (7%, 9/121). Sera from 6 rats (Rattus spp.), 8 Muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), and 13 snakes were N-antibody-negative.  During November and December 1983 and 1984 (Table 7), blood samples were obtained from White- tailed Deer killed by hunters in Accomack Co, Vir- ginia, and in Somerset Co, Maryland. JC virus N CNWR: 1983 Bay area: 1984 antibody was detected in 21 (66%) of 32 deer from % blood- % blood- Maryland and in 13 (87%) of 15 deer from Vir- No. coll. fed No. coll. fed ginia. Age-specific antibody prevalence rates in-dicated that 54% (7/13) of the deer were less than  1 year old, 83% (15/18) were 13-24 months old,  d 75% (12/16) were older than 2 years.  an 0 years. In October 1983, blood was obtained from 15 goats that ran freely at a farm adjacent to the PCS.   Seven of these had N antibody to JC virus, includ-ing 2 (25%) of 8 goats less than 1 year old and 5 (71%) of 7 goats over 1 year old. Additional evi- dence of JC virus transmission was detected in free- ranging goats bled at 3 additional sites, the most distant of which was ca. 30 km south of the PCS. ",

DISCUSSION = "DISCUSSION  During the 25 years that arbovirus studies have been conducted on the Delmarva Peninsula, 5 JC virus isolates have been obtained from mosquitoes (Buescher et al. 1970; Saugstad et al. 1972; LeDuc etal. 1975; Gargan, pers. comm.). All of these were from Ae. canadensis; however, the combined min-imum field infection rate (MFIR) of 1:64,000 was quite low. Considering this low isolation rate, it is difficult to attribute to this species all JC virus trans- mission to vertebrates. This conclusion is under- scored by our data demonstrating widespread evi- dence of virus transmission to White-tailed Deer and domestic goats on the Delmarva Peninsula. A temporal association between the occurrence of Ae. cantator and JC virus seroconversions in do- mestic goats was observed in 1983 and 1984. How- ever, no virus was obtained from field-collected or laboratory-reared adults of that species. Also, this virus was not obtained from 12,060 Ae. cantator collected as part of a concurrent study in this lo- cality, and earlier attempts to isolate JC virus from 41,608 additional specimens were unsuccessful (Buescher et al. 1970; Saugstad et al. 1972; LeDuc et al. 1975). Thus, virus was not isolated from ca. 100,000 mosquitoes of this species that originated from the Delmarva Peninsula. In contrast, 8 JC virus isolations were reported from Ae. cantator in Connecticut (Sprance et al. 1978; Main et al. 1979) and New York (Grayson et al. 1983). The overall MFIR was ca. 1:2,800, a value suggesting that this species is a possible vector.  Although lacking the temporal and spatial as- sociations with JC virus seroconversions observed for the preceding species, many Ae. sollicitans (136,000) and Ae. taeniorhynchus (14,500) were as- sayed by earlier workers on the Delmarva Penin- sula (Buescher et al. 1970; Saugstad et al. 1972;  LeDuc et al. 1975) without isolation of JC virus. The failure to associate this virus with these species in the present study further confirms these findings and indicates that these species were not involved in the maintenance and transmission of this virus. Although Anopheles species were not assayed for virus, data implied that members of this genus were not vectors of JC virus. This was supported by the large number that fed on sentinel goats, which showed no apparent evidence of JC virus infection.  Issel (1973) suggested that tabanids or black flies, because of their early season feeding on White- tailed Deer, may play a role in the transmission of JC virus. We were not able to substantiate this in our study. Although C. niger and H. lasiophthalma occurred during the 1983 projected JC virus trans- mission period, virus was not obtained from these insects. DeFoliart et al. (1969) isolated JC virus from the latter species; however, Miller et al. (1983) were unable to orally infect 4 tabanid species. Thus, if these biting flies were involved in JC virus trans- mission, their role probably would be limited to that of 2 mechanical vector.  While JC virus has not been associated with ticks, 1 CAL group virus, snowshoe hare (SSH), has been	isolated from these arthropods (Newhouse et al. 1963). The close association between A. america- num and White-tailed Deer, a frequent vertebrate host of JC virus, 1s well established (Patrick & Hair 1977). Both this tick species and D. variabilis in- fested free-ranging goats during and after the pro- jected period of virus transmission, but the pro- longed period of tick—-mammal interaction was not compatible with the discrete seasonal transmission pattern observed for JC virus at the PCS.  Based on isolations from mosquitoes (DeFoliart etal. 1969; Iversen et al. 1969; Sprance et al. 1978; Main et al. 1979; Gargan, pers. comm.), JC virus is most frequently encountered during the late spring and early summer. Seroconversions in do- mestic goats at the PCS during this study and in a single goat earlier (Watts et al. 1982) conformed to this pattern.  The overall prevalence of JC virus N antibody in White-tailed Deer was consistent with the report from the Delmarva Peninsula by Watts et al. (1982), and the distinct age-class stratification found among White-tailed Deer with JC virus N antibody has been reported elsewhere (Issel et al. 1972b; Hoff et al. 1973; Issel et al. 1973). The antibody de- tected in young deer was apparently of maternal origin and may afford temporary protection against JC virus infections (Issel 1974).  The prevalence of JC virus N antibody in the Eastern Cottontail at CNWR was similar to that reported earlier (Watts et al. 1982) but greater than the 5% observed by Pinger et al. (1975) in Iowa. The prevalence in the Virginia Opossum was also much greater than reported (4%) by Pinger et al. (1975). Neutralizing antibody has not been re- ported previously in the Raccoon. The role of this mammal in the ecology of JC virus is not under- stood, but the prevalence rate does not approach that of the White-tailed Deer.  Evidence accumulated for the CAL serogroup viruses has incriminated Aedes mosquitoes as the primary vector for California encephalitis virus (Crane et al. 1977), KEY virus (LeDuc 1978), LAC virus (Watts et al. 1972), SSH virus (McLintock et al. 1976), Tahyna virus (Danielova & Ryba 1979), and TVT virus (Andrews et al. 1977). In general, data revealed that the MFIR was higher than 1 isolate per 1,000 mosquitoes, 1.e., rates substan- tially higher than that observed for JC virus in Ae. canadensis. This difference, together with the ex- ceptionally infrequent association of this virus with Ae. canadensis and the failure to isolate JC virus from the other major Aedes species, does not appear to account for the high prevalence of infection in White-tailed Deer on the Delmarva Peninsula. The recurrent and temporally confined seroconver- sions in domestic goats at the PCS were suggestive of emergence, transmission, and rapid disappear- ance of the principal hematophagous arthropod vector, which may also maintain the virus during the winter. This concept was suggested earher by Issel et al. (1972b). They proposed that *“.. .JC virus circulates in a cycle involving deer but in- dependent of mosquitoes and biting flies.” Based on their seasonal occurrence and association with large mammals, Culicoides species (Ceratopogoni- dae) are likely candidates for future field studies.",
