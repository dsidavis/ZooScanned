Summary
The possible role of pigs as arbovirus maintenance hosts and their importance as amplifier hosts was studied.
Blood samples from 464 pigs of all ages collected in 1962 and 1964 were tested against 10 arboviruses. Antibodies
to Japanese encephalitis and Getah viruses were particularly prevalent and their calculated monthly infection
rates were 19-59; and 13-39 respectively. In 1969, 447 pigs were bled monthly throughout the year and the
infection rates for Japanese encephalitis virus were calculated in pigs during the first year of life. Infection rates
were not uniform throughout the year; the rate increased as the pig grew older and there was a marked seasonal
increase in the infection rate in the period from November to January. This coincided with the seasonal major
population peak of Culex tritaeniorhynchus following intense breeding of this mosquito prior to rice planting.
It is suggested that, in Sarawak, the pig acts as a maintenance host of Japanese encephalitis in a cycle involving
C. gelidus mosquitoes and also acts as an important amplifier host towards the end of the year in a cycle
involving C. tritaeniorhynchus. It is further suggested that Getah virus is maintained in a similar cycle between
C. tritaeniorhynchus and pigs.
