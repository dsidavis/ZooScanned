ABSTRACT. Outbreaks of infectious disease, characterized by fever and occasionally by exanthema and
edema, occurred in racehorses and breeding horses in Japan during the summer and autumn, 1983.
According to the serological and virological tests, it was shown that the epidemics were caused by Getah
virus infection. The viruses isolated from the blood of horses in two areas were found to be serologically
identical with the Sakai strain of Getah virus isolated from a horse during an outbreak of the disease in
1978. Relationships between these two epidemics were discussed.—KEY WORDS: Getah virus, horse.
