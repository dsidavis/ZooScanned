were generally scattered throughout the state. Dur-     occur early in the southern area and then extend
ing the 1952 epidemic, approximately as many cases 
of encephalitis in horses were reported in some of
the so-called “fringe counties” as in the endemic
areas. This may have been due to the possibility that
a large percentage of the horses in the endemic areas
either had immunity due to exposure in previous
years or had been vaccinated, whereas in the “fringe
areas” a higher percentage of the horses were prob-
ably susceptible and vaccination in those areas was
not started until actual cases were reported. In the
endemic areas, most of the cases occurred among
horses up to two years of age while those that oc-
curred in the “fringe areas” were in older horses,
suggesting that the older animals in the endemic 
areas had been exposed and had developed immu-
nity whereas those in the “fringe areas” had not
been exposed previously and were not immune.
The disease in horses follows an epidemiologic
pattern similar to that in man. Very rarely does
more than one case occur on any one ranch although
there may be 10 to 20 other horses there. The cases
occur sporadically and at widely scattered places.

 northward as the summer progresses; however, this
 is not always the pattern, as cases have been re-
 ported as far north as Tehama County earlier than
 in the southern San Joaquin Valley counties. In
 1952, a large number of horse cases were reported
 in Riverside County late in August when horse cases
 were receding in the San Joaquin Valley.
 An experimental study developed from the opin-
 on held by many investigators that a horse ill with
 western equine encephalomyelitis is a hazard to
 humans in his vicinity. This study1 showed that a
 horse inoculated with the western equine virus
 developed viremia as early as 24 hours after inocu-
 lation and in some cases the viremia lasted up to
 five days. Approximately seven to nine days after
 the horse was inoculated and four days after vire-
 mia was no longer present, rises in temperature
 were noted and about the tenth or eleventh day the
 horse became clinically ill. The fifth day following
 inoculation, the virus could be found only in the
 brain tissue. This indicated that the infected horse
 did not present any hazard to people or to other
